Okay, great choice! Let's get your Windows 10 machine set up for Tauri development with React/Vue.

Here are the necessary steps:

1. Install Microsoft C++ Build Tools:

Tauri uses Rust for its backend, and Rust needs the C++ build tools for linking on Windows.

Go to the Visual Studio Downloads page: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

Scroll down to "Tools for Visual Studio" (or look under "Other Tools, Frameworks, and Redistributables").

Find "Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022" (or the latest version) and click Download.

Run the installer (vs_BuildTools.exe).

In the installer window, select the "Workloads" tab.

Check the box for "Desktop development with C++". No other workloads are strictly necessary for Tauri.

Click "Install" in the bottom right. This might take some time and disk space.

You might need to restart your computer after the installation is complete.

2. Install WebView2:

Tauri uses the WebView2 component (based on Microsoft Edge/Chromium) to render your web-based UI (React/Vue) on Windows.

Modern Windows 10/11 versions usually have this pre-installed.

You can double-check or install the Evergreen Bootstrapper from Microsoft's site just to be sure: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/#download-section (Download the "Evergreen Bootstrapper"). Run the downloaded file if you got it. If it's already installed, it will tell you.

3. Install Rust:

Tauri's core is written in Rust. You need the Rust compiler (rustc) and package manager (cargo). The easiest way is using rustup.

Go to the official Rust website: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

Download rustup-init.exe for Windows (64-bit).

Run the downloaded rustup-init.exe.

It will likely prompt you in the terminal:

1) Proceed with installation (default)
2) Customize installation
3) Cancel installation


Press 1 and Enter to proceed with the default installation unless you have specific needs.

Once it's finished, it will say "Rust is installed now. Great!".

Important: Close and reopen any open Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Windows Terminal windows. This ensures the PATH environment variable is updated so Windows can find cargo and rustc.

4. Install Node.js and npm (or Yarn/pnpm):

Even though Tauri uses Rust for the backend, you need Node.js to manage your frontend dependencies (React/Vue, Tailwind, Tiptap) and run the frontend development server and build process.

Go to the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/

Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version recommended for most users.

Run the installer and follow the prompts. Accept the defaults unless you have a reason not to. This will install both node and npm (Node Package Manager).

Important: Again, close and reopen any open Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Windows Terminal windows to update the PATH.

(Optional) If you prefer Yarn or pnpm over npm:

Install Yarn: npm install --global yarn

Install pnpm: npm install --global pnpm

5. Verify Installations:

Open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell window.

Check Rust:

rustc --version
cargo --version
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

You should see version numbers printed for both.

Check Node.js and npm:

node --version
npm --version
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

You should see version numbers printed for both. (If you installed yarn/pnpm, check them too: yarn --version / pnpm --version).

You don't need a specific command to verify the C++ Build Tools or WebView2; the Tauri build process will usually complain later if they are missing or misconfigured.

Summary of Requirements:

Microsoft C++ Build Tools (via Visual Studio Installer with "Desktop development with C++" workload)

WebView2 Runtime (usually pre-installed, Evergreen Bootstrapper available)

Rust (via rustup-init.exe)

Node.js LTS (includes npm)

Once you have completed all these steps and verified the installations, your Windows 10 machine is ready!

Next Step: You can now proceed to create your first Tauri project using its CLI, choosing React or Vue with TypeScript when prompted.
