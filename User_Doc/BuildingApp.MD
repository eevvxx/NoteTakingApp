i would like to build this app but is there another option not using Tailwind CSS


# Note Taking App - Technology Stack Summary

This document outlines the core technologies selected for building the cross-platform note-taking application.

## Core Desktop Framework

*   **Tauri:** Chosen for building a cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux) desktop application using web technologies for the frontend and Rust for the core backend logic. Provides high performance, small bundle size, and native system access.

## Frontend

*   **Vue.js (v3):** The JavaScript framework selected for building the user interface. Chosen for its component-based structure and reactivity.
*   **TypeScript:** Used for writing the Vue.js frontend code, providing static typing for better code quality and maintainability.
*   **Vite:** The build tool used for the frontend development server and production builds. Comes integrated with the chosen Vue+TS template and known for its speed.

## Backend (Tauri Core)

*   **Rust:** The language used for Tauri's backend process. Handles native operations like file system access, database interaction (planned), and communication with the frontend.

## Styling

*   **Tailwind CSS (v4):** A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the user interface. Integrated via PostCSS within the Vite build process.
*   **PostCSS:** Used by Vite to process CSS, enabling plugins like Tailwind CSS and Autoprefixer.
*   **Autoprefixer:** A PostCSS plugin (used alongside Tailwind) to automatically add vendor prefixes to CSS rules for browser compatibility.

## Rich Text Editor

*   **Tiptap:** A headless, framework-agnostic rich text editor toolkit. Used for the main note editing area.
*   **@tiptap/vue-3:** Tiptap's official Vue 3 integration package.
*   **@tiptap/starter-kit:** A Tiptap extension bundle providing common text formatting features (paragraphs, bold, italic, etc.).

## Local Data Storage (Planned)

*   **Filesystem Access (via Tauri/Rust):** To store note content, images, audio, and other attachments directly on the user's local disk.
*   **SQLite (via Rust Crate like `rusqlite`):** Planned for storing note metadata (titles, dates, tags), task information, and relationships between notes and files in a local database file.

## Development Tooling

*   **Node.js:** Required runtime environment for frontend tooling (Vite, npm, etc.).
*   **npm:** The chosen package manager for handling frontend dependencies (Vue, Tiptap, Tailwind, Vite, etc.).
*   **Windows 10:** Development operating system.
*   **Microsoft C++ Build Tools:** Required dependency for Rust compilation on Windows.
*   **WebView2:** Required runtime on Windows for Tauri to render the web frontend.
