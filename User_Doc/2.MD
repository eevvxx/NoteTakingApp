Yes, absolutely! Tauri is designed to be cross-platform, and Windows is a primary target platform.

Here's how it works and what it means:

Native Windows Applications: When you build a Tauri application for Windows (using tauri build), it compiles your Rust core code into a native Windows executable (.exe).

WebView2: For the frontend (your HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript with React/Vue/etc.), Tauri utilizes the Microsoft Edge WebView2 component on Windows. WebView2 is based on the Chromium engine (like Chrome and Edge) and is typically pre-installed on modern Windows 10 and Windows 11 systems. If it's not present, the Tauri installer can prompt the user to install it or bundle it. This means your app uses the efficient, up-to-date web rendering engine provided by the OS itself, rather than bundling a separate browser like Electron often does.

Build Process: The Tauri CLI handles the complexities of building for Windows. It will produce standard Windows installers (.msi bundles or .exe setups) that users can run to install your application just like any other native Windows program.

Development: You can develop and test your Tauri application directly on Windows. You'll need the necessary build tools installed (like the Rust toolchain and Microsoft C++ Build Tools), but the Tauri documentation guides you through this setup.

In summary: Tauri is an excellent choice if you want to create a modern, performant desktop application that runs natively on Windows (as well as macOS and Linux).
